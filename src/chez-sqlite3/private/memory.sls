;;; (chez-sqlite3 private memory): counted foreign blocks (ADR-0005,
;;; ADR-0011). The only library check-seam lets import foreign-alloc and
;;; foreign-free.
;;;
;;; A block is malloc'd memory, where Valgrind sees an overrun or a leak.
;;; Each one is counted as a block in (chez-sqlite3 private counters) while it
;;; lives, and kept in a table of live blocks, behind a mutex, so that freeing
;;; an address that is not a live block, twice or never allocated here,
;;; raises before anything reaches free.
;;;
;;; Each block's malloc, its entry in the table and its count happen in one
;;; critical section, and so do its removal, free and count down: an
;;; interrupt that escapes, a keyboard or timer handler that invokes a
;;; continuation, cannot fall between them and leave a block no table and no
;;; count sees, nor leave the table's mutex held.
;;;
;;; A refusal names the value it refused by shown-value: a number as itself,
;;; a string by its kind, never its text (ADR-0013, decision 7).
;;;
;;; It never loads libsqlite3.
