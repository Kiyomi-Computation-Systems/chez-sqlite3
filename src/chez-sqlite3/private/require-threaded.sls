;;; (chez-sqlite3 private require-threaded): refuse a Chez that is not
;;; threaded, or is older than 10.4.0, by name (ADR-0001).
;;;
;;; chez-sqlite3 uses Chez's thread system: the counters' mutex (ADR-0005),
;;; and later each connection's owning thread (the brief, §3c). Chez builds
;;; it only into threaded builds. On a --nothreads Chez a library importing
;;; those names dies at import with a bare "missing import for make-mutex".
;;; The floor is Chez 10.4.0 (ADR-0001): an older Chez dies somewhere in the
;;; first library that needs something newer, with a message that does not
;;; say why. This library raises a message naming the requirement instead.
;;; It raises from a macro, so the refusal comes while this library is being
;;; expanded: before the library importing it goes on to its next import.
;;;
;;; A pre-release comes before the release it is numbered for, and
;;; (scheme-version-number) answers that release's numbers for it, so
;;; 10.4.0-pre-release.N is below the floor and 10.5.0-pre-release.N is not.
;;; (scheme-version #t) ends "-pre-release.N" for one. It is asked only at the
;;; floor, where it matters, and a Chez that old takes the argument. The more
;;; direct (scheme-pre-release) is not imported: a Chez older than the floor
;;; may lack it, and a missing import is the bare message this library exists
;;; to replace.
;;;
;;; Hence its one condition: every other library under src/ imports it first
;;; among its imports. Chez processes a library's imports in order, and a
;;; thread primitive imported ahead of it still fails with the bare message
;;; (measured by chez-libuv on a --nothreads Chez 10.4.1).
;;; tests/test-require-threaded.sps holds that order, and expands copies of
;;; this library in which (threaded?) answers #f and (scheme-version-number)
;;; and (scheme-version #t) answer versions on each side of the floor. It
;;; exports nothing.
