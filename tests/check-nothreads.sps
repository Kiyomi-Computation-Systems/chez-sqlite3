;;; make check-nothreads: imports every library under the directory named on the
;;; command line (make passes src) and requires each import to be refused by
;;; name, as (chez-sqlite3 private require-threaded) refuses a Chez that is not
;;; threaded (ADR-0001). It is run by CI on a Chez built with --nothreads, the
;;; one place a refusal meets a real non-threaded Chez. On a threaded Chez every
;;; import loads, so it FAILS there, naming each library: that failure is its
;;; red run, and it is why make test does not run it.
;;; tests/test-check-nothreads.sps holds each rule on a fixture tree.
;;;
;;; Every library form, in any .sls file under the directory, is checked,
;;; private ones too: ADR-0001's amendment has every library under src/ import
;;; the refusal first, so each must be refused. (chez-sqlite3) is checked, with
;;; no edit here, when it arrives. The program finds the libraries by reading
;;; the files as data. It puts the directory on Chez's library path itself, so
;;; one argument says both where to look and where Chez finds the libraries.
;;;
;;; For each, it evaluates (environment '(rnrs) NAME) inside a guard. That
;;; imports the library without running its body (a body runs only when one of
;;; its bindings is referenced), so it cannot load libsqlite3, and it raises
;;; where Chez raises an import: while expanding the libraries the import
;;; reaches. The refusal is what that raise must be: a syntax violation, from
;;; who chez-sqlite3, whose message starts with refusal-marker. Anything else, a
;;; different message or who included, is not the refusal and fails, and so does
;;; an import that loads. (chez-sqlite3 private require-threaded) refuses at
;;; expansion from that exact condition, and tests/test-require-threaded.sps
;;; expands it with (threaded?) answering #f.
;;;
;;; It fails closed, because a check that passes on nothing is vacuous. It names,
;;; and exits 1 on, each of these:
;;;
;;;   - a library whose import loaded, or raised something but the refusal,
;;;     with what was raised;
;;;   - no library under the directory, or no such directory;
;;;   - a .sls file it cannot read as data, a dangling symbolic link among them;
;;;   - a symbolic link to a directory, which it does not follow.
;;;
;;; It prints one line for each library on stdout when it is refused, and each
;;; problem on stderr and then a count of them on a failure. It exits 0 or 1,
;;; never a count.
