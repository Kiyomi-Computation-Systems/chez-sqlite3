;;; (floors): chez-sqlite3's version floors, and the check that holds the
;;; README to them (ADR-0008).
;;;
;;; packaging/floors.sexp is the one file that writes the Chez and SQLite
;;; floors: one datum, ((chez "M.m.p") (sqlite "M.m.p")), the keys exactly
;;; these, in this order. README.org's Requirements section states the floors
;;; for a reader; `make check-floors` holds it to the file. The Scheme code
;;; that enforces a floor is held to it by behaviour, in
;;; tests/test-require-threaded.sps, which reads the floors from here. CI
;;; arrives in slice 4, and the workflow rules come with it.
;;;
;;;   floors-problems   what is wrong with the floors file's text
;;;   check-floors      what is wrong with the floors file or the README
;;;   parse-floors      the floors file's text as a Floors, or a raise
;;;   read-floors       the checked-in floors file as a Floors
;;;   floor-text        a floor by name, as text
;;;   floor-numbers     a floor by name, as a list of naturals
;;;   requirement-lines the README lines the floors call for
;;;
;;; A Floors is the file's datum itself: ((chez "10.4.0") (sqlite "3.45.1")).
;;; Test-only: it lives in tests/, which make test puts on Chez's library
;;; path, and it imports only (rnrs) and a few of Chez's own bindings, so
;;; `make check-floors` needs no deps. Its own suite is
;;; tests/test-check-floors.sps.
;;;
;;; The checks never evaluate the file: its text is read as data, with Chez's
;;; reader, and every problem comes back as a line of text that starts with
;;; the path of the file at fault, so a failure names what to edit.
;;;
;;; What the floors file must be:
;;;
;;;   - one datum, a list of entries, each (key "version"), a symbol and a
;;;     string, and nothing else but comments;
;;;   - the keys chez and sqlite, each once, in that order;
;;;   - each version a string of three dot-separated naturals, written
;;;     without a sign, a space or a leading zero (major.minor.patch).
;;;
;;; What the README must hold: one line "** Requirements", and under it, up to
;;; the next heading of any level, the list lines requirement-lines gives,
;;; whole, as one list, in order. A list line is one that starts, after any
;;; indent, with "- " or "+ ", or a number and "." or ")" and a space, or, when
;;; indented, "* ". Prose and blank lines between them are not compared.
;;; Lists under other headings are not compared either. The comparison is
;;; exact, a space at a line's end included: each line is named as written.
