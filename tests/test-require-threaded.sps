;;; The suite for (chez-sqlite3 private require-threaded): chez-sqlite3 needs a
;;; threaded Chez of at least 10.4.0, and refuses any other by name (ADR-0001).
;;;
;;; Chez builds make-mutex, fork-thread and the rest of its thread system
;;; only into threaded builds, so on a --nothreads Chez a library importing
;;; them dies at import with a bare "missing import for make-mutex". The
;;; refusal raises a readable message instead, while it is being expanded.
;;; That helps only if it is expanded first: Chez processes a library's
;;; imports in order. So every library under src/ but the refusal itself
;;; imports (chez-sqlite3 private require-threaded) first among its imports.
;;; This suite reads each library's import form as data and holds that order.
;;;
;;; It also holds the refusal itself, on this Chez: it expands a copy of the
;;; refusal's source in which each call (threaded?) answers #f, as a
;;; --nothreads Chez's does, and requires the refusal's message. It does the
;;; same with each call (scheme-version-number) answering a version and each
;;; call (scheme-version #t) answering the version's text, for a release or
;;; for a pre-release, in rows on each side of the floor, 10.4.0. A
;;; pre-release comes before the release it is numbered for, so
;;; 10.4.0-pre-release.N is below the floor and 10.5.0-pre-release.N is not.
;;;
;;; The floor is held to packaging/floors.sexp, the one file that writes it
;;; (ADR-0008). Each expected message takes the floor's text from that file,
;;; and further rows are built from it. The literal rows stay: they name
;;; 10.4.0 and its neighbours, so a floor changed in both places at once is a
;;; decision a reader of this suite sees.
;;;
;;; make test runs every suite from the repository root, where src/ is. An
;;; empty or missing src/ fails here by name, never passes for want of rows.
;;;
;;; Each expected value is a symbol the code under test cannot produce by
;;; failing. SRFI-64 turns a raise in the actual expression into #f.
