# `make check-dev`: holds make dev to what it promises, by running it as a
# person would, through make, with forms piped in for its REPL. Each case
# runs in a fresh copy of the tree with no build/, as a fresh clone has, so
# make dev must run make deps itself. Adapted from chez-curl's
# tests/check-dev.sh. Two cases:
#
#   repl     make dev runs make build first, so its output must hold
#            build's "libsqlite3 loaded and accepted" report once, then the
#            REPL's banner once, then exactly one line "check-dev: ok
#            version VERSION (NUMBER)" and one "check-dev: ok path PATH
#            (SOURCE)". The piped forms print them only once
#            (chez-sqlite3 private native), (chez-sqlite3 private
#            libsqlite3-info), (chez-sqlite3-testing) and (srfi :64) have all
#            imported, which takes the suites' whole library path and make
#            deps' links, and native has loaded libsqlite3. Until M1 slice 4
#            there is no public library to import instead. The version and
#            path lines must equal build's own, after their labels, whole. A
#            REPL that fails an import prints the error, reads on, and exits 0
#            at the end of its input, so the lines are the evidence, and the
#            exit status only has to be 0.
#   refused  with CHEZ_SQLITE3_LIBRARY naming no file, make dev must fail
#            with build's refusal, and no REPL may start: neither the banner
#            nor a line may appear.
#
# A copy is the working tree without .git, build/ and .claude/ (Claude
# Code's local state, which can hold whole worktrees), with the chez-srfi
# checkout but none of vendor/'s .git files, as check-memory-gate's copy:
# a copy holding a .git anywhere is refused. Nothing in it runs git. Each case
# runs under timeout, so a REPL that never reads the end of its input cannot
# hang the check. make check-dev passes MAKE and TIMEOUT, the tools it found.
# Run directly, the script takes make and timeout from PATH.
