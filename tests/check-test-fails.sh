# `make check-test-fails`: proves that `make test` fails on a bad suite, by
# planting one in a copy of the tree (ADR-0007). One case per plant:
#
#   fails        a suite with a failing test   make test names it FAIL
#   no-tests     a suite that runs no test     make test names it FAIL
#   hangs        a suite that never ends       make test names it HUNG
#   exit-line    a suite that ends with the    check-suites names it, and
#                siblings' exit line           no suite runs
#   early-exit   a suite with a failing test   check-suites names it, and
#                that exits 0 before its       no suite runs
#                verdict
#   nested-exit  the same, with the exit 0     check-suites names it, and
#                inside a when                 no suite runs
#   empty        an empty file (Chez fails     check-suites names it, and
#                it, exit 255, unexplained)    no suite runs
#   leaks        a suite whose tests pass,     make test names it FAIL, and
#                but which counts a            suite-exit-status names the
#                statement it never frees      count left (ADR-0005)
#   seam         a private library that        check-seam names the import,
#                imports foreign-alloc, a      and no suite runs
#                name only (chez-sqlite3
#                private memory) may import
#   floors       README's Chez line says       check-floors names the line,
#                10.3.0, not the floor         and no suite runs
#   ci           job memory given a            check-ci names the key, and
#                continue-on-error key         no suite runs
#   no-suites    every suite deleted           make test refuses to pass
#
# The copy holds no real suite, so no slow one can run into the 5 s
# TEST_TIMEOUT. The plant is tests/test-0-plant.sps. After it sorts
# tests/test-1-after.sps, a suite that passes: in the first three cases its
# pass line shows that make test runs the suites after a failure. Each plant
# but no-tests has a passing test of its own, so only the planted fault can
# fail it.
#
# A case requires a non-zero exit, and compares the lines starting
# "check-suites: " or "test: " as a whole: check-suites' verdict, the plant's
# outcome, the after-suite's pass line, and the count. The leaks case also
# compares the lines starting "suite-exit-status: ", the seam case those
# starting "check-seam: ", the floors case those starting "check-floors: ",
# and the ci case those starting "check-ci: ".
#
# The copy is the working tree without .git, build/ and .claude/ (Claude
# Code's local state, which can hold whole worktrees), and with the
# chez-srfi checkout, so make deps works there and nothing is fetched.
# Nothing in the copy runs git. make deps relinks build/ in the copy. Its
# src/ holds two of the tree's own libraries, whatever else the tree holds:
# (chez-sqlite3 private counters), which every suite's (chez-sqlite3-testing)
# imports, and (chez-sqlite3 private require-threaded), which it imports
# first. README.org and packaging/floors.sexp are the tree's own, and agree,
# so check-floors passes in every case but floors.
#
# The leaks plant raises a count with no matching release, as a library that
# made a statement and never finalized it would. No library makes a native
# object yet, so the plant stands in for one (ADR-0005).
#
# `make check-test-fails` passes MAKE and TIMEOUT, the tools it found. Run
# directly, the script takes make and timeout from PATH.
