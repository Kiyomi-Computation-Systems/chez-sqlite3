;;; tests/memory-plant-leak.sps: a PLANTED definite leak. Not a suite.
;;;
;;; `make check-memory-gate` runs it through `make test-memory` and requires
;;; the gate to FAIL on it, with Valgrind's own loss record in the log
;;; (ADR-0005).
;;;
;;; It allocates a 777-byte foreign block and drops its address: no live
;;; value holds it, so Valgrind counts it definitely lost. A Chez fixnum
;;; holds an address shifted, never as the raw pointer, so the dropped
;;; integer does not keep the block reachable (measured in M0 slice 3:
;;; .plans/research/memory-gate/). A plain run exits 0: check-memory-gate
;;; requires that first, so a red gate can only mean Valgrind saw the leak.
;;; The size is a sentinel: nothing else in a run loses a block of 777
;;; bytes.
;;;
;;; It is not named tests/test-*.sps, so neither make test nor make
;;; test-memory runs it unasked.
