;;; make check-seam: reads every .sls file under the directory named on the
;;; command line (make passes src) as data, with Chez's reader, and evaluates
;;; nothing. It names, with the file and the import or the export, each
;;; library that breaks one of these rules (ADR-0009, amended):
;;;
;;;   (c) a library imports (chezscheme) other than as (only (chezscheme)
;;;       name ...), or names in that list one that is not in
;;;       allowed-chez-names, or imports (rnrs eval). Those reach a library by
;;;       a route this check does not read: a body (import ...), include,
;;;       eval, load, $primitive. (scheme) is (chezscheme) under another name;
;;;   (d) the boundary: a library under src/ is (chez-sqlite3), the public
;;;       library, or (chez-sqlite3 private name ...), a private one, and
;;;       nothing else. The test helpers, (chez-sqlite3-testing), live in
;;;       tests/ and are no part of it, nor is (chez-sqlite3 util). With
;;;       nothing else under src/, no library but (chez-sqlite3) and the
;;;       private ones can import a private one, so that needs no rule of its
;;;       own. Tests may import private libraries: they are never read;
;;;   (e) a library imports a library that is not on the import allowlist:
;;;       the (rnrs ...) libraries but (rnrs eval), (only (chezscheme) name
;;;       ...), and the (chez-sqlite3 ...) libraries. Any other,
;;;       (chezscheme csv7) and a third-party library among them, could reach
;;;       a library by a route this check does not read;
;;;   (f) a library imports, from (chezscheme), a name that only some libraries
;;;       may import, and is not one of them. library-only-chez-names holds
;;;       each such name with the libraries that alone may import it: the
;;;       blocks' foreign-alloc and foreign-free for (chez-sqlite3 private
;;;       memory); load-shared-object, foreign-procedure, foreign-entry,
;;;       foreign-entry?, foreign-ref and foreign-set! for (chez-sqlite3
;;;       private native), which alone calls into libsqlite3, and with
;;;       getenv and machine-type reads the world discovery is given, and
;;;       foreign-sizeof, format, format-condition? and display-condition for
;;;       native too, the size of its out-pointers and the loader's message. A name
;;;       no library may import is not in allowed-chez-names at all, so it is
;;;       refused everywhere, the libraries above among them: define-ftype
;;;       (v1 reads no C struct, and a function ftype would bind a C entry
;;;       point around foreign-procedure), lock-object (ADR-0011 rejected it),
;;;       foreign-callable and foreign-callable-entry-point (v1 has no
;;;       callbacks), fork-thread (a connection belongs to its caller's
;;;       thread);
;;;   (g) a library exports a name it imports from (chezscheme), as an
;;;       identifier or as the internal name of a (rename (internal
;;;       external)) spec. Otherwise a library rule (f) lets import a name
;;;       could hand it on to one that may not, and any library could hand
;;;       allowed-chez-names past the seam to a consumer. The names a library
;;;       imports from (chezscheme) are those of its (only (chezscheme) name
;;;       ...) import sets: rule (c) refuses every other import set of
;;;       (chezscheme), each wrapper among them, so no prefix or rename makes
;;;       a local name this rule does not see. An export spec that is neither
;;;       an identifier nor (rename (internal external) ...), the only two
;;;       Chez accepts, is an export it cannot read;
;;;   (h) a library imports a (chez-sqlite3 ...) library that no library
;;;       under the directory defines. Chez would load it from another
;;;       directory on its library path, and the suites' path holds tests/:
;;;       a library there, which no rule here reads, could bind anything. A
;;;       library counts as defined wherever under the directory it stands:
;;;       rule (i) then fails any that is not at its name's path, alone in
;;;       its file;
;;;   (i) a file holds more than one library, or a library stands anywhere
;;;       but its name's path: (chez-sqlite3 private extra) in
;;;       chez-sqlite3/private/extra.sls, (chez-sqlite3) in chez-sqlite3.sls.
;;;       Chez looks for a library at that path in each library directory in
;;;       turn, so one defined elsewhere under the directory could satisfy
;;;       rule (h) while another directory supplied the library Chez loads;
;;;   (k) a library that imports a name from library-only-chez-names exports
;;;       no name it binds with define-syntax at the top of its body (inside a
;;;       begin too). Rule (g) does not see a macro whose template uses the
;;;       name: (define-syntax call (syntax-rules () ((_ x) (foreign-alloc
;;;       x)))), exported, would hand foreign-alloc to every library. Internal
;;;       macros are legal. Syntax bound any other way, a let-syntax or a
;;;       macro-defining macro, is not read: such a library is held by review.
;;;
;;; The letters are chez-curl's, where rules (a), (b) and (j) belonged to its
;;; two families and its escape hatch. This project has one family and no
;;; hatch, so there is no (a), (b) or (j); (k) is new.
;;;
;;; The lists are allowlists: a name or a library that is not on one fails,
;;; so a route nobody thought of is closed until a reviewer opens it.
;;; allowed-chez-names holds exactly the names src/ imports from (chezscheme),
;;; and a name of library-only-chez-names joins it when its library lands and
;;; imports it; rnrs-libraries holds the standard libraries.
;;; tests/test-check-seam.sps runs this program on a tree for each rule.
;;;
;;; A library is a (chez-sqlite3 ...) library when the first identifier of its
;;; name is chez-sqlite3, so (chez-sqlite3) is one and (chez-sqlite3-testing)
;;; is not. Imports are found through the import-set wrappers for, only,
;;; except, prefix, rename and library, and a version reference after a name
;;; is dropped. Tests are exempt by never being read: they live in tests/,
;;; not under src/.
;;;
;;; It fails closed, because a check that passes on nothing is vacuous. It
;;; names, and exits 1 on, each of these:
;;;
;;;   - no .sls file under the directory;
;;;   - a symbolic link to a directory, which it does not follow;
;;;   - a file Chez could load as a library that it does not read: one ending
;;;     in an extension of (library-extensions) but .sls, source (.ss, .scm,
;;;     .sch, .chezscheme.sls) or compiled (.so, .chezscheme.so);
;;;   - a file it cannot read as data, or that holds an #!eof literal, which
;;;     would end the reading early;
;;;   - a datum that is not a (library <name> (export ...) (import ...) ...)
;;;     form, the file's first or any later one: every library form in a file
;;;     is checked;
;;;   - an import it cannot read, which includes one nested deeper than
;;;     max-depth;
;;;   - an export it cannot read.
;;;
;;; A name starting with .# is skipped when it is a dangling symbolic link:
;;; Emacs leaves one, a lock file, beside a source it has open. A regular file
;;; or a directory named .#..., or a link that resolves, is no lock file. Chez
;;; loads a library from .#g.sls as it does from g.sls, so each is read and
;;; checked like any other.
;;;
;;; It prints one verdict on a pass, to stdout, or each problem and then a
;;; count of them on a failure, to stderr. It exits 0 or 1, never a count.
