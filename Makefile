# Three places name the chez-srfi commit, and nothing else keeps them equal:
# Akku.lock (what a consumer installs), the gitlink the superproject records
# (what a clone checks out) and the submodule's checkout (what the tests
# import). The gitlink and the checkout move separately: `git checkout` in the
# submodule moves the checkout, `git add` moves the gitlink, and `git
# submodule update` undoes the first, so each is read. The lock names a short
# commit (Akku's `akku.N.<short>`), so it is compared as a prefix, and a
# prefix shorter than seven digits is not read at all: an empty or one-digit
# one would match every commit. An empty or half-made submodule directory is
# no error to git, which answers there for the superproject, so the checkout
# counts only when git's toplevel for it is that directory itself. Read-only.
# It needs git, which the container does not have: run it on the host and in
# CI. `make test` does not run it.
