# scripts/ci/build-chez.sh PREFIX [--nothreads]
#
# Builds Chez Scheme at its floor from the release tarball and installs it into
# PREFIX, for .github/workflows/ci.yml (ADR-0001: apt's Chez is 9.5.8, below
# the floor, so CI builds the floor itself). It takes no version: the floor is
# the one packaging/floors.sexp holds (ADR-0008), read by scripts/ci/floor.sh,
# which fails closed on a file that does not give exactly one well-formed Chez
# version. Nothing a workflow says, an env key or a matrix value, can change
# it. The tarball is checked against the sha256 pinned below before anything is
# unpacked. Threaded by default, as chez-sqlite3 needs (ADR-0001, amended);
# --nothreads builds the Chez the nothreads lane imports the libraries on.
# Afterwards scripts/ci/check-chez.sh asks the installed scheme for its
# version and (threaded?), and fails unless they are the floor and what was
# asked for: a build that came out other than it was configured is no build.
#
# PREFIX must be an absolute path. Run it once for a PREFIX: it installs over
# what is there. Nothing is installed outside PREFIX.
#
# Changing the floor is a reviewed change: fetch the release tarball, compare
# its sha256 with the digest the GitHub releases API lists for the asset, and
# add it to tarball_sha256 below. A floor with no sha256 here fails.
