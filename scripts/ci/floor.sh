# scripts/ci/floor.sh NAME
#
# Prints one floor, NAME being chez or sqlite, as packaging/floors.sexp at the
# repository root writes it (ADR-0008): one line, three dot-separated numbers.
# The root is two directories above this script.
#
# CI states no floor anywhere. This is how a step, or a script, gets one:
# scripts/ci/build-chez.sh and check-chez.sh call it for the Chez floor, and
# scripts/ci/report-sqlite.sh for the SQLite floor it reports. It reads
# nothing else, no argument and no environment variable, so nothing a
# workflow says, an env key or a matrix value, can change what it prints.
#
# It fails closed, because a wrong floor is worse than none: it prints a floor
# only when the file is one list of (key "version") entries and holds exactly
# one entry for NAME, whose version is well-formed: three naturals,
# major.minor.patch, each ASCII digits with no leading zero. The file is read as text, not evaluated.
# A ; comment is dropped before anything is read. A # outside a comment is
# refused: it is a datum comment or a block comment, which Scheme's reader
# skips and this script would not. `make check-floors` holds the whole file to
# its rules, in Scheme; this script holds only what it must to be right about
# NAME. The other floors' versions are not its concern.
#
# It prints the floor on stdout and exits 0, or says what is wrong on stderr
# and exits 1, or 2 on a usage error.
